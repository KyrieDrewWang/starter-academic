abstract: The poor generalization ability of BP neural network based model updating hybrid test is solved by introducing a novel method called AdaBoost regression tree algorithm into the model updating procedure in hybrid test. During the learning phase, the regression tree is selected as a weak regression model to be trained, then multiple trained weak regression models are integrated into a strong regression model, finally the training results are generated through voting by all the selected regression model. A 2-DOF nonlinear structure was numerically simulated by utilizing the online AdaBoost regression tree algorithm and the BP neural network algorithm as a contrast. The results show that the prediction accuracy of online AdaBoost regression algorithm is 48.3% higher than that of BP neural network algorithm, which verifies that the online AdaBoost regression tree algorithm has better generalization ability compared with BP neural network algorithm. Furthermore, it can effectively eliminate the influence of weight initialization and improve the prediction accuracy of restoring force in hybrid test.
