Vision-based displacement measuring methods, as a videogrammetric technology, has shown great application potential in the displacement response measurement in a shaking table test. Based on artificial targets, high-speed CMOS cameras and image processing algorithms, the displacement of the structure model can be obtained with no contact to the model surface. To address the limitation of the traditional displacement transducer and verify the precision of the un-contact vision-based displacement measurement method. Dynamic experiments of various amplitude, frequency and wave types were conducted using a high-precision electric shaking table in this paper. Computer vision and 3-D DIC method are used in the processing of the obtained images. In the computer-vision method, OTSU based Ellipse fitting and grayscale centroid target positioning methods are proposed, and the subpixel Harris method is applied as a comparison. Besides, a 3-D DIC method using the artificial targets is also applied to measure the 3-D displacement of the targets. The high-precision electric shaking table is used to simulate the earthquake action. Traditional displacement sensors, laser sensor, displacement transducer, accelerometer and seismometer gauge are used as comparison. Results verified the effectiveness and precision of the vision-based methods under different vibration.
